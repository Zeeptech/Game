<1st Idea>
	Based by our time at Telia?
	Fight Our past Colleagues / Customers
	Last boss is Either Mathilda, Johan dennelind or Joel Danielsson
	GoyJoy is small HP pot
	Rockstar is big HP pot
	JOEL IS A ROAMING LAST BOSS That searches the player
	If Joel sees the player he will begin a chase
	If Joel gets to the player The last BossFight will begin
	If the player Encounters joel too early in the game, he will not have the power to defeat him

	When the player has gotten the 4 secret abillities to defeat Joel he can safely start the encounter by letting Joel get to him
	With the hidden abillities he will attack joel WHERE IT HURTS (So. Hur gåre med dina loggor i paint? etc...)
	The player will escape Telia by getting fired for killing Joel in cold blood (As he just wanted to be your friend) Winning the game.
